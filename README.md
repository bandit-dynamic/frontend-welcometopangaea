## "Welcome to Pangaea!"

Link to deployed application: https://pangaealandgroupinc.vercel.app/

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Project Description: 

General App Idea/Purpose: "Welcome to Pangaea!" is an application intended to market towards prospective land owners and investors and assist them by readily providing raw land inventory at fair market value, or better! The application allows the user to browse a list of purchasable land, view individual parcels with information listed about each property. This site is my very own company's site that I previously built a few months ago using a hosting service (All frontend work conducted thru a GUI; server-side services are already provided by hosting service). I want to recreate this site in the ways that we've been instructed, for daily use, and have traffic flow in and out of it, becoming my new "daily driver" for business and sales.

This site provides users with the ability to find land and properties. Users can view, create, and edit favorite/unfavorite properties. Users can delete their property listings. Users can register and enjoy complete anonymity and profile protection with either their email logins or Google credentials.

If you're ready to sell your vacant land, no matter where in America or the world it is, we're ready to give you a fair cash-in-hand offer.

Stop the frustration of paying back taxes on undeveloped land. Let us buy it off you regardless of your situation.

We help owners who have inherited an unwanted property and vacant land, are behind on taxes, owe liens, and everyone in between!

We can plug you into our network of hundreds of land investors, multiplying the likelihood of getting your land recognized and sold with no extra hassle to you!

### MVP Goals
> Create a full CRUD webapp (without Delete, so I guess just CRU) app with MongoDB, Express, Next.js, and Node.js with a complete database model. Complete with a Readme.md file. <br />

### Stretch Goals
> Written in order of difficulty to tackle them once I hit MVP:
> 1) Add a second model for a user contact form. Integrate email.js with this feature so if a user fills out the form, an admin email box gets hit.

> 2) Create a "Podcasts" page, that allows users to view YouTube educational videos. (new model)
